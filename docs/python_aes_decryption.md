Below is a rough Python equivalent of the logic you see in that C function using the PyCryptodome library. It’s not a perfect one-to-one mapping of the Windows CryptoAPI calls (since they’re Windows-specific), but it replicates the same high-level steps:

Hash the Password with SHA-256 to derive a 256-bit key.
Use that Key to decrypt the data with AES-256.
Important Notes / Caveats

The original code uses Microsoft’s CryptDeriveKey(CALG_AES_256, ...) with no explicit mention of mode (CBC, ECB, etc.), IV, or padding. Windows might apply defaults behind the scenes.
The snippet below assumes AES in ECB mode (no IV) or CBC with a known/constant IV. If your real code used a different mode or an IV, you must adapt accordingly.
If the original data included padding or if it embedded the IV somewhere, you’ll need to handle that (e.g., slicing off the first 16 bytes to use as the IV for CBC).

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import hashlib

    """
    Rough Python equivalent of the C AESDecrypt() function.

    :param password:       The plaintext password used to generate the key
    :param encrypted_data: The data (ciphertext) to be decrypted
    :return:               The decrypted plaintext (bytes)
    """

    # 1. Hash the password to get a 256-bit key
    #    (equivalent to CryptCreateHash -> CryptHashData -> CryptDeriveKey)
    key = hashlib.sha256(password.encode('utf-8')).digest()  # 32 bytes

    # 2. Create an AES cipher object
    #    Here we assume no IV or that the IV is all zero, replicating 
    #    what might be the default or a simplified approach.
    #    If your data includes an IV or uses CBC mode, adapt accordingly.
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)  # or MODE_CBC with an IV

    # 3. Decrypt the data
    decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)

    # 4. If there's padding, you'd remove it here (e.g., PKCS#7).
    #    This is a simple example that doesn't handle custom padding logic.
    
    return decrypted_data


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Suppose we have some ciphertext from the original code:
    sample_ciphertext = b"... your encrypted data here ..."

    # The password used for encryption in the original C code
    password_used = "supersecret"

    plaintext = aes_decrypt(password_used, sample_ciphertext)
    print("Decrypted plaintext:", plaintext)
Things to Check/Adapt
Mode & IV: If the Windows code was using AES-256 in CBC mode (often the default on older CryptoAPI calls) with an IV, then you need to replicate that exactly: retrieve the IV from the data or use a known IV.
Padding: You may need to handle PKCS#7 (or another scheme) to remove extra bytes added when encrypting. PyCryptodome has utilities for that (or you can do it manually).
Exact Behavior: On Windows, CryptDeriveKey(CALG_AES_256, ...) can have its own nuances that might not be 100% identical to “just hash with SHA-256.” Typically it’s close, but be aware of differences.
With those disclaimers in mind, this Python code should give you a good starting point that mirrors the main steps of the C function.
